## Setup

To set up the development environment, follow these steps:

1. Install [foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation#using-foundryup)
1. Ensure you have [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) installed.
1. Run the setup command to prepare the environment:

```shell
pnpm run setup

## Run Tests

To execute solidity tests:

```shell
forge test
```

## Lint

We use [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to lint the project

```shell
pnpm run lint
```

Lint process covering `solhint`, `forge fmt`, `forge test` and many other checks
